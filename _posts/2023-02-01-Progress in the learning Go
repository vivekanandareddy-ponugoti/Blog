# Progress in learning a new language:
I started learning GoLang by reading the GoLanguage official documentation, watching tutorials on youtube, some minor projects.
First i had to install GoLang on my mac from <a href=https://go.dev/dl>Download Go</a> website and installed it on my laptop.


## Learning basics of Go Language:
At first i created a .go file in visual studio code and implemented a Hello World!<a href=https://github.com/vivekanandareddy-ponugoti/Blog/blob/main/code/basics/helloWorld.go>Hello World!</a> program in it.
I learned the command to run a go program: <code>go run fileName.go</code>

## Experimenting with packages in Go
After writing my first hello world program, I wanted to learn how to work with multiple programs. Here, I noticed that programs in GoLang are divided in form of packages just like any other object oriented programming language. Each package can contain more than one function. The project is initialized from the main function and we can use fucntions from other packages in the module by using the import command.
To initialize a module in Go we use command <code>go mod init module_name</code>
To import a module in Go we use command <code>import moduleName/packageName</code>

## Conclusion:
In my progress of learning GoLang. I have understanding of creating a new project/module using <code>go mod init</code>, The starting point of the project will be the main function of that module which is located in <code>package main</code>.We can declare more than one fucntion in a package and is very easy to import/export these fucntions from one package to another.
