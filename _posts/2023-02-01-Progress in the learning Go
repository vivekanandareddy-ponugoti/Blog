# Progress in learning a new language:
I started learning GoLang by reading the GoLanguage official documentation, watching tutorials on youtube, some minor projects.
First i had to install GoLang on my mac from <a href=https://go.dev/dl>Download Go</a> website and installed it on my laptop.


## Learning basics of Go Language:
At first i created a .go file in visual studio code and implemented a Hello World!<a href=>Hello World!</a> program in it.
I learned the command to run a go program: <code>go run fileName.go</code>

### Advantages in using Go language
The key advantages in using go programming language are simplicity, performance, concurrency, garbage collection and lots of libraries.
