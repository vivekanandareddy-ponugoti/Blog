The first two weeks in learning Go Language were very productive as i covered most of the basics. From this week i will be working on minor go projects and research on all the external libraries that can be used to make advances in my software development.

## Static webpage in GoLang:
After learning all the fundamentals of GoLanguage, I started working on some advanced concepts where this week i made a static website which is run on port 8080. It is a basic website which outputs a greeting message on one page and a form to store and output the same data with a success message. While buiding this static website i came across some unfamiliar libraries and syntax used in go language. Here is the link to access code: <a href="https://github.com/vivekanandareddy-ponugoti/Blog/tree/main/code/Intermediate/go-server">Static server</a>

## Steps to host a static webserver in GoLang:
To make a static webserver using GoLang, I created a main.go file and two static html files(pages) to display greeting and provide a form to submit user information. The new libraries used in building a server are: <code>"log"</code>and <code>"net/http"</code> There are many functions provided by these libraries which are used to catch log errors and make http requests/response. 

## Conclusion:
In the progress of learning a new language, I am able to make good progress and got to learn a lot of new things. In my upcoming blog posts i would be working more on go mobile development and learn how to implement algorithms to solve real world problems.
