Welcome to my blog post 6. In the process of learning go for software engineering i have a clear understanding of go syntax. So, in the past week i have made progress by building a book management system using a mySQL database.

## Using GoLang in building web severs:


## A book management system using go language and MySQL:



## My learnings while building a web server:
Go is indeed a great programming language for developing mobile applications, especially for its simplicity, concurrency, and robustness. And the Go mobile package makes it easy to create efficient native mobile apps.

To install the Go mobile package, you can use the following command:

<code>go get golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile</code>

After installing, you need to initialize it with the following command:

<code>gomobile init</code>

This will set up the necessary environment variables and create a few files to enable mobile development.

To compile a Go mobile program, you can use the gomobile bind command, which generates a library file that can be used in a native mobile app. Here's an example command:

<code>gomobile bind -target=android -o mylib.aar my/package</code>

## Challanges faced in my learnings

This will generate an AAR (Android Archive) file named mylib.aar that contains the compiled code from the my/package directory.

In addition to these commands, you can use other gomobile commands to build, install, and test your mobile app. For more information about the gomobile package and its usage, you can refer to the official documentation at <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile">GoMobile Documentation</a>
