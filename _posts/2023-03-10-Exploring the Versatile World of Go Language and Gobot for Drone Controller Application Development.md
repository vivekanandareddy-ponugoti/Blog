Spring break is around the corner, and I am thrilled to share my exciting journey with Go language and IoT application development. As I continue to explore this powerful language, I have discovered the extensive range of external libraries and packages it offers, making it an ideal choice for building robust and efficient IoT applications.

One of the most impressive environments available for IoT development is Gobot, which provides a plethora of dependencies to support diverse IoT devices. It has an extensive library of platform-specific drivers for different IoT devices and protocols, making it easier to create customized applications. I found Gobot to be highly intuitive, user-friendly, and easy to use, especially with its comprehensive documentation and pre-built code samples.

To start building applications with Gobot, I first initialized a Go module in a new folder using the command <code>gomod init file_name</code>. This allowed me to create a Gobot environment by installing all the required packages through the command <code>go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/</code>. This creates a go.sum file, which enables me to develop applications seamlessly. The documentation for Gobot is highly detailed and offers a wealth of information, including pre-built code samples that helped me understand the basics and get started with building applications.

Gobot offers support for a wide range of devices, including drones, robots, and other IoT devices, making it highly versatile. I found building a basic drone controller application with Gobot to be a breeze thanks to its comprehensive platform support for various drivers, including Mavlink, DJI Tello, Parrot, and Sphero. Each of these drivers provides support for different protocols and sensors, making it easy to create customized applications for different types of drones.

As part of our software engineering class, we are building a Mavlink protocol model of an application to communicate with the drone. The Mavlink protocol is widely used in most drone controller boards and provides a simple and robust method for communicating with drones.

Overall, my experience with learning Go language and exploring its applications in IoT devices has been incredibly enjoyable. Although there are relatively fewer online resources for Go compared to other popular programming languages, the documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly. The Gobot website also provides boilerplate code for all platforms, making it easier to get started with building applications.
