The first two weeks of learning Go were very productive, as I covered most of the basics. From this week on, I will be working on minor Go projects and researching all the external libraries that can be used to make advances in my software development.

## Static webpage in GoLang:
After learning all the fundamentals of Go, I started working on some advanced concepts. This week, I made a static website that runs on port 8080. It is a basic website that outputs a greeting message on one page and has a form to store and output the client's data with a success message. While building this static website, I came across some unfamiliar libraries and syntax used in Go. The link to the access code is provided below:

## Steps to host a static webserver in GoLang:
To make a static webserver using GoLang, I created a main.go file and two static html files (pages) to display greetings and provide a form to submit user information. The new libraries used in building a server are: <code>"log"</code>and <code>"net/http"</code> There are many functions provided by these libraries that are used to catch log errors and make HTTP requests and responses.

## Conclusion:
In the process of learning a new language, I am able to make good progress and have learned a lot of new things. In the coming blog posts, I'll be focusing on mobile app development and learning how to use algorithms to solve real-world problems.Â
